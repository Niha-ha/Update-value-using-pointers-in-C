# Update Values Using Pointers in C

This project demonstrates how to use pointers in C to update the values of two integers. Specifically, the program:

- Calculates the **sum** of two integers and stores it in the first variable.
- Calculates the **absolute difference** of the same two integers and stores it in the second variable.

# 🔧 HackerRank Pointer Problem Solution

This repository contains a C program that solves a basic HackerRank challenge using pointers. It updates two integers by:
- Storing their **sum** in the first variable
- Storing their **absolute difference** in the second

This problem is part of HackerRank's C programming track.


## 💻 Environment
- **Language**: C
- **IDE Used**: Code::Blocks
- **Compiler**: GCC (via Code::Blocks setup)

## 📂 File Name
`update_with_pointers.c`

## 📌 How It Works
1. Takes two integers as input.
2. Uses a function `update(int *a, int *b)`:
   - `*a` becomes the **sum** of the original values.
   - `*b` becomes the **absolute difference** of the original values.
3. Prints the updated values.

## 🔢 Sample Input
```
4 5
```

## 📤 Sample Output
```
9
1
```

## 🧠 Concepts Used
- Pointers
- Function arguments by reference
- Absolute value using `abs()`
